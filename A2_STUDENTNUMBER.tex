\begin{enumerate}
    \item % answer to question 1: Why does this model place "feathers" earlier in the tree than "airborne"?
    
    \item ...% answer to question 2: How could you find the instances in the dataset that end up in a particular leaf, but are misclassified?
    

    \item ... % answer to question 3: Why are the trees not always the same?
    
    \item ... % answer to question 4: Put a picture of a tree in your report that you think is particularly bad, and explain why it might have been fitted that way.

    \item ... % answer to question 5: Make a table comparing the different model/configurations. Report the mean and the standard deviation of the accuracy score.

    \end{table}
    
    \item ... % answer to question 6: which would you prefer? A high-accuracy model with large standard deviation, or a somewhat lower accuracy model with lower standard deviation? Explain why.
    
    \item ... % answer to question 7: Experiment with different values of $k$. What is the effect on the accuracy and standard deviation of using larger or smaller $k$? Why do you think that is?
