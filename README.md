## Assignment 2: Decision Trees

This repository contains the exercises and questions for assignment 2.

## How to start
* Start by cloning this repository to your computer. 
* You can do the assignment on your own computer, or use Google Colab.
    1. To run it **locally**, make sure that you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Try running `jupyter notebook` from the command line. 
       
       * If it works, open `A2.ipynb` and continue with the explanations and tasks there.
       
        * If that doesn't work, you first have to install Jupyter notebook. You may also have to install other packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn` and `pytest`.
    2. To use **Google Colab**, upload `A2.ipynb` and proceed with the notebook from there. 

If you have difficulty installing a needed package, we recommend either asking for help or switching to Colab. In Colab, to install a package, you can run a cell with the command:

`!pip install (name of package)`

The `!` will send the command out of the notebook, to the command line of Google Colab.
